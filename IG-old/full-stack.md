# On-Site Full-Stack Programming Project (2 hours)

## Generative Instagram

Instagram is so 2023! The new hotness is not about photos and selfies you take yourself — you just generate them with AI, and share them for your friends and the world to see.

## Requirements

* Create a simple **NextJS/React app** where a user enters a prompt that generates images using **OpenAI DALL·E 2**.
* The user can select their favorite images and **publish** them to a feed.
* The app displays the feed on the main page and lets users **“heart”** images.
* The stack consists of two parts:

  * A **frontend** (React / Next.js)
  * A **backend API** the frontend communicates with
* Persisting data to a database must be handled in the backend and surfaced to the UI.
* **No user authentication** needed for now.
* The app will run on **localhost**, but can optionally be deployed to **Vercel** or a similar hosting platform.

We’ll use AI-assisted tools to complete this project — **ChatGPT**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Aider**, and any other generative coding tools of your choice.

If you want, I can also turn this into a Notion-ready block with toggles, callouts, or a structured project template.
